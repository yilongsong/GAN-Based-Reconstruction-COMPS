# GAN-Based-Reconstruction-COMPS

Replication of the paper, "Image-Adaptive GANs based Reconstruction"

Antonio, Yilong, and Daisuke (Fall 2022)

# Goals

(1) Figure out Compressed Sensing, n/m, and Gaussian A.
(2) Move on to IAGAN step with Adam/Bicubic_A
(3) Measure/evaluate results for CSGM step, IA step
(4) BP step
